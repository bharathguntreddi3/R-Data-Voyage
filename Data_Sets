R has some inbuilt DataSets some frequently used data sets are, 'iris' , 'mpg' and 'mtcars' Datasets

1.	The 'iris' data comprises of 150 observations with 5 variables. We have 3 species of flowers: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica and for each of them the sepal length and width and petal length and width are provided.
